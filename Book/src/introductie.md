# Introduction

In this MdBook, I write out and explain the individual task of the Process and Safety module.

The process is an industrial conveyer belt system. 
Task 1 manages the operation and process of the conveyer belt system.
Task 2 checks for object presence and notifies an operator with an alarm in case an object is missing.
The function calculates the speed of the conveyer based on the load.
The GVL holds conveyor status, object sensors, start and alarm acknowledge buttons, speed settings,cycletime and other variables.
